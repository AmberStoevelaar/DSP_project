From 👉v4.50👈 onwards, `PreTrainedModel` will NOT inherit from `GenerationMixin`, and this model will lose the ability to call `generate` and other related functions.\n",
      "  - If you're using `trust_remote_code=True`, you can get rid of this warning by loading the model with an auto class. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#auto-classes\n",

      "The text outlines the terms and conditions for using Apple Software on a supported Mac Computer, including automatic downloads and installations of software changes. The number of copies that can be downloaded depends on the user's license with Apple. The software is licensed under the MPEG-4 Visual Patent Portfolio License for personal and non-commercial use. It also discusses the use of Gracenote software, licensed by MPEG LA, for personal and non-commercial activities, which enables applications to identify discs and files and obtain music-related information. The text also mentions the use of Setup/Migration Assistant for transferring software between Apple-branded computers. Users are advised to suspend the ability to pay with virtual Supported Cards on their Mac Computer by putting it into Lost Mode. If the license for the Gracenote software terminates, users must cease all use of the Gracenote Data, Software, and Servers. The text also mentions potential risks such as loss of profits, corruption or loss of data, and failure to transmit or receive any data. The text also mentions the Wallet feature, which allows users to store virtual representations of credit, debit, and prepaid cards. The countries mentioned could possibly be the locations where these conditions apply. The text outlines the terms of use for Apple Software, including the immediate termination of a Lessee's use upon discovery or notification of a breach. It states that there is no guarantee that the Gracenote Software or Servers will be error-free or uninterrupted. The software allows for real-time, on-device caption generation (\"Live Captions\") and the creation of a personal voice feature for non-commercial use. The leased Apple Software should be used solely for providing Permitted Developer Services, with each Lessee agreeing to the license terms. Each lease period must last for a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. The license agreement stipulates that each lease period must be at least 24 consecutive hours. During this time, the End User Lessee should have sole and exclusive use and control of the Apple Software and the Apple-branded hardware it is installed on. By using Apple Pay and Wallet, users consent to Apple's transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of all related information to provide these services. The Apple Software is only supported on Apple-branded hardware that meets specific system requirements set by Apple. Users also agree to use Apple Pay in accordance with these terms. The text discusses the terms of a software license agreement for macOS, which also governs the use of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. The user agrees not to alter any proprietary notices within the Apple Software. The AMR encoding and decoding functionality in the product is not licensed for use in cellular communications infrastructure. The agreement also mentions that if the Consumer Contract Act of Japan applies, terms limiting Apple's liability for damages from breach will be in effect. Japan has imposed terms on Apple that prevent the company from limiting its liability for damages resulting from contract breaches or torts, unless the damage is due to Apple's intentional misconduct or gross negligence. Apple does not guarantee the appropriateness or availability of its software, services, and third-party materials for use in any specific location. The use of a modified device with the services is prohibited and can result in restricted access to the services. Some Apple software and services may display or include third-party content or links to third-party websites. Apple requires advance notice from each lessor before the use of iCloud. Users must agree to use iCloud and its features according to the latest terms and conditions, which can be reviewed on Apple's website. Users must also use the Apple Software and Services in compliance with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region they reside in or where they download or use the software and services. Apple, Apple Payments Services, and their affiliates are all parties to the Apple Pay Terms with respect to the services they provide. Users are reminded that no oral or written information or advice given by Apple or an Apple authorized representative creates a warranty. The text states that Apple does not provide a warranty for its software and services, and does not guarantee the accuracy or availability of any data displayed by its software and services. It also states that Apple is not responsible for any third-party services or materials, and is not a party to any agreement between the user and a third party. The Gracenote service, used by Apple, tracks queries for statistical purposes. Upon termination of the license, the user must stop using the Apple software and services. The text states that Apple is not responsible for any agreements between the user and a third party, particularly regarding installment payment services. The user acknowledges that Apple Software and Services contain proprietary content owned by Apple or its licensors, protected by intellectual property laws, including copyright. The GPL and LGPL are included with the Apple Software. Neither the FAA nor Apple are liable for any loss, damage, claim, liability, expense, or penalty. When using Apple Pay, only one device can remotely connect at a time to control the Apple Software's graphical desktop session displayed on the Home Mac. The text describes the ability to control the graphical desktop session of Apple Software running on a Home Mac. It also allows a reasonable number of devices to remotely connect simultaneously to observe the same session, provided they do not control the software. Apple is not responsible for updates, maintenance, warranty, technical support, or services for the modified software. Users may need to authenticate with Apple to receive Apple Eligible Content. The delivery of this content through a Caching Enabled Mac does not change the terms of receiving it. The license does not permit unauthorized actions with the software. The text outlines the terms and conditions for using Apple Software. It states that the software cannot be installed, used, or run on non-Apple-branded computers. The software and its documentation are defined as \"Commercial Products\" and \"Commercial Computer Software\". Users are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to download, install, use, and run one copy of the software for personal, non-commercial use, subject to the Services and Content Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. If the software is governed by a separate license, the terms of that license will apply. The intellectual property rights of any content accessed through Apple Software belong to the respective content owner. Certain features of the Apple Software may automatically download and cache eligible content on an Apple-branded computer running the software. To use these features, users need the latest version of the operating software, an Apple Account associated with an iCloud account in good standing, and internet or cellular data access. Ownership of the Apple Software remains with Apple or its licensors, who reserve all rights not explicitly granted. The text outlines the terms of a license for Apple Software obtained from the Mac App Store or through a software update. The license allows for a one-time permanent transfer of all rights to the software to another party, under certain conditions: the software must be transferred with Apple-branded hardware, and the transfer must include all of the software. The software will periodically check with Apple for updates. For UK-based consumers, the license is governed by local laws. The license also prohibits actions such as reverse engineering, disassembling, decrypting, modifying, or creating derivative works of the software, unless such restrictions are prohibited by law. The text discusses licensing terms for Apple Software, particularly those that include Open-Sourced Components and AVC encoding/decoding functionality. Commercial use of H.264/AVC requires additional licensing from MPEG LA, LLC. Users can remove cached Apple Eligible Content and disable Content Caching Features. Some services may require an Apple Account and acceptance of additional terms. Users must also confirm they are not located in certain restricted countries. This license agreement between the user and Apple pertains to the Apple Software and supersedes all previous understandings. It details how user information is sent to Apple and its potential uses. The Apple Software allows access to various Apple and third-party services, including the iTunes Store, Mac App Store, Apple Books, Game Center, iCloud, Maps, News, and others.

The Gracenote Software and Gracenote Data are licensed \"AS IS\". Any changes to the agreement must be in writing and signed by Apple. Users are also required to use the Content Caching Features for personal use only. The text outlines the terms of a license agreement for non-commercial or internal use of Apple software. The user acknowledges that Apple is not responsible for the software's configuration. The license also covers any changes to the software provided by Apple. The software can be used by a consumer for personal and non-commercial activities, such as encoding and decoding AVC video. The user is allowed to make one copy of the software, excluding certain embedded firmware. The agreement does not limit any rights of Apple or other copyright owners. Apple allows users to backup their firmware embedded in Apple-branded hardware in machine-readable form, but the backup must include all copyright. Apple and its licensors can change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Apple Software and Services without notice. Third-party software and services may not be compatible with Apple Software and its installation may affect their availability and usability. Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their Mac Computer, Supported Devices, Apple Account, Touch ID information, device passcodes, and other authentication credentials. The text discusses the use of personal authentication credentials in connection with services. It mentions the use of Adobe Color Profile software included with Apple software, but Adobe has no obligation to provide support. If a user chooses to pay in installments or purchase and pay later with a third party using Apple Pay, they are contracting with the third party. The user can use the fonts included with the Apple software to display and print content, but can only embed fonts in content if permitted by the embedding restrictions. The text discusses the terms of Apple's software license. It mentions that fonts can be embedded in content if allowed by the restrictions. Apple provides updates to its software, but is not a financial institution. The license also covers leasing for permitted developer services.

      "The text outlines the terms and conditions for using Apple Software on a supported Mac Computer, including automatic downloads and installations of software changes. The number of copies that can be downloaded depends on the user's license with Apple. The software is licensed under the MPEG-4 Visual Patent Portfolio License for personal and non-commercial use. It also discusses the use of Gracenote software, licensed by MPEG LA, for personal and non-commercial activities, which enables applications to identify discs and files and obtain music-related information. The text also mentions the use of Setup/Migration Assistant for transferring software between Apple-branded computers. Users are advised to suspend the ability to pay with virtual Supported Cards on their Mac Computer by putting it into Lost Mode. If the license for the Gracenote software terminates, users must cease all use of the Gracenote Data, Software, and Servers. The text also mentions potential risks such as loss of profits, corruption or loss of data, and failure to transmit or receive any data. The text also mentions the Wallet feature, which allows users to store virtual representations of credit, debit, and prepaid cards. The countries mentioned could possibly be the locations where these conditions apply. The text outlines the terms of use for Apple Software, including the immediate termination of a Lessee's use upon discovery or notification of a breach. It states that there is no guarantee that the Gracenote Software or Servers will be error-free or uninterrupted. The software allows for real-time, on-device caption generation (\"Live Captions\") and the creation of a personal voice feature for non-commercial use. The leased Apple Software should be used solely for providing Permitted Developer Services, with each Lessee agreeing to the license terms. Each lease period must last for a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. The license agreement stipulates that each lease period must be at least 24 consecutive hours. During this time, the End User Lessee should have sole and exclusive use and control of the Apple Software and the Apple-branded hardware it is installed on. By using Apple Pay and Wallet, users consent to Apple's transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of all related information to provide these services. The Apple Software is only supported on Apple-branded hardware that meets specific system requirements set by Apple. Users also agree to use Apple Pay in accordance with these terms. The text discusses the terms of a software license agreement for macOS, which also governs the use of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. The user agrees not to alter any proprietary notices within the Apple Software. The AMR encoding and decoding functionality in the product is not licensed for use in cellular communications infrastructure. The agreement also mentions that if the Consumer Contract Act of Japan applies, terms limiting Apple's liability for damages from breach will be in effect. Japan has imposed terms on Apple that prevent the company from limiting its liability for damages resulting from contract breaches or torts, unless the damage is due to Apple's intentional misconduct or gross negligence. Apple does not guarantee the appropriateness or availability of its software, services, and third-party materials for use in any specific location. The use of a modified device with the services is prohibited and can result in restricted access to the services. Some Apple software and services may display or include third-party content or links to third-party websites. Apple requires advance notice from each lessor before the use of iCloud. Users must agree to use iCloud and its features according to the latest terms and conditions, which can be reviewed on Apple's website. Users must also use the Apple Software and Services in compliance with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region they reside in or where they download or use the software and services. Apple, Apple Payments Services, and their affiliates are all parties to the Apple Pay Terms with respect to the services they provide. Users are reminded that no oral or written information or advice given by Apple or an Apple authorized representative creates a warranty. The text states that Apple does not provide a warranty for its software and services, and does not guarantee the accuracy or availability of any data displayed by its software and services. It also states that Apple is not responsible for any third-party services or materials, and is not a party to any agreement between the user and a third party. The Gracenote service, used by Apple, tracks queries for statistical purposes. Upon termination of the license, the user must stop using the Apple software and services. The text states that Apple is not responsible for any agreements between the user and a third party, particularly regarding installment payment services. The user acknowledges that Apple Software and Services contain proprietary content owned by Apple or its licensors, protected by intellectual property laws, including copyright. The GPL and LGPL are included with the Apple Software. Neither the FAA nor Apple are liable for any loss, damage, claim, liability, expense, or penalty. When using Apple Pay, only one device can remotely connect at a time to control the Apple Software's graphical desktop session displayed on the Home Mac. The text describes the ability to control the graphical desktop session of Apple Software running on a Home Mac. It also allows a reasonable number of devices to remotely connect simultaneously to observe the same session, provided they do not control the software. Apple is not responsible for updates, maintenance, warranty, technical support, or services for the modified software. Users may need to authenticate with Apple to receive Apple Eligible Content. The delivery of this content through a Caching Enabled Mac does not change the terms of receiving it. The license does not permit unauthorized actions with the software. The text outlines the terms and conditions for using Apple Software. It states that the software cannot be installed, used, or run on non-Apple-branded computers. The software and its documentation are defined as \"Commercial Products\" and \"Commercial Computer Software\". Users are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to download, install, use, and run one copy of the software for personal, non-commercial use, subject to the Services and Content Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. If the software is governed by a separate license, the terms of that license will apply. The intellectual property rights of any content accessed through Apple Software belong to the respective content owner. Certain features of the Apple Software may automatically download and cache eligible content on an Apple-branded computer running the software. To use these features, users need the latest version of the operating software, an Apple Account associated with an iCloud account in good standing, and internet or cellular data access. Ownership of the Apple Software remains with Apple or its licensors, who reserve all rights not explicitly granted. The text outlines the terms of a license for Apple Software obtained from the Mac App Store or through a software update. The license allows for a one-time permanent transfer of all rights to the software to another party, under certain conditions: the software must be transferred with Apple-branded hardware, and the transfer must include all of the software. The software will periodically check with Apple for updates. For UK-based consumers, the license is governed by local laws. The license also prohibits actions such as reverse engineering, disassembling, decrypting, modifying, or creating derivative works of the software, unless such restrictions are prohibited by law. The text discusses licensing terms for Apple Software, particularly those that include Open-Sourced Components and AVC encoding/decoding functionality. Commercial use of H.264/AVC requires additional licensing from MPEG LA, LLC. Users can remove cached Apple Eligible Content and disable Content Caching Features. Some services may require an Apple Account and acceptance of additional terms. Users must also confirm they are not located in certain restricted countries. This license agreement between the user and Apple pertains to the Apple Software and supersedes all previous understandings. It details how user information is sent to Apple and its potential uses. The Apple Software allows access to various Apple and third-party services, including the iTunes Store, Mac App Store, Apple Books, Game Center, iCloud, Maps, News, and others. The license also covers the terms and conditions for remotely connecting from a device to an Apple-branded computer running the Apple Software, referred to as the \"Home Mac\". The text refers to a license agreement for Apple Software. The license allows users to install and run the software on each Apple-branded computer they own or control, running specific versions of macOS. Commercial enterprises or educational institutions are permitted to use one copy of the software. The license also allows users to use virtualized copies of the software in connection with certain services. However, the use of System Characters is restricted. The Gracenote Software and Gracenote Data are licensed \"AS IS\". Any changes to the agreement must be in writing and signed by Apple. Users are also required to use the Content Caching Features for personal use only. The text outlines the terms of a license agreement for non-commercial or internal use of Apple software. The user acknowledges that Apple is not responsible for the software's configuration. The license also covers any changes to the software provided by Apple. The software can be used by a consumer for personal and non-commercial activities, such as encoding and decoding AVC video. The user is allowed to make one copy of the software, excluding certain embedded firmware. The agreement does not limit any rights of Apple or other copyright owners. Apple allows users to backup their firmware embedded in Apple-branded hardware in machine-readable form, but the backup must include all copyright. Apple and its licensors can change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Apple Software and Services without notice. Third-party software and services may not be compatible with Apple Software and its installation may affect their availability and usability. Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their Mac Computer, Supported Devices, Apple Account, Touch ID information, device passcodes, and other authentication credentials. The text discusses the use of personal authentication credentials in connection with services. It mentions the use of Adobe Color Profile software included with Apple software, but Adobe has no obligation to provide support. If a user chooses to pay in installments or purchase and pay later with a third party using Apple Pay, they are contracting with the third party. The user can use the fonts included with the Apple software to display and print content, but can only embed fonts in content if permitted by the embedding restrictions. The text discusses the terms of Apple's software license. It mentions that fonts can be embedded in content if allowed by the restrictions. Apple provides updates to its software, but is not a financial institution. The license also covers leasing for permitted developer services. Location data provided by Apple software is intended for basic navigation and planning purposes only. The Apple software cannot be exported or re-exported unless authorized by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction where the software was obtained. Apple may provide access to third-party software or services as part of its software package, upgrades, updates, or supplements. Users are not allowed to exploit these services. The text is a part of a legal agreement, likely from Apple, stating that users are not allowed to exploit Gracenote data, software, or servers unless expressly permitted. It warns that sharing credentials with a third party could lead to unauthorized transactions. Users are also prohibited from using Apple software and services to spam, defraud, harass, or violate the rights of others. Apple is not responsible for any misuse by the user or any offensive messages received as a result of using their software and services. The text also mentions a link to Apple's legal sales support and implies a return policy. The text outlines terms and conditions for Apple's services and software. It states that to obtain a refund, the entire hardware/software package must be returned. Redistribution of Flight Data requires prior written consent from the FAA. It also clarifies that Apple does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service, continued availability, correction of defects, or compatibility with third-party software or services. Some software libraries and third-party software included with Apple Software are free and licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the GNU Library. The text discusses software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the GNU Library/Lesser General Public License (LGPL). It specifies that the software documentation is licensed to U.S. Government end users only as commercial products and with the same rights as other end users. The text also states that Apple, Apple Payment Services, and their affiliates do not assume liability for any commerce activity made using Apple Pay or Wallet. Instead, users are advised to refer to their agreements with their card issuer, payment network, or merchant for any questions or disputes related to their supported cards and associated commerce activities. The text discusses any questions or disputes related to supported cards and associated commerce activities. It specifies that customers who are consumers (those using the Apple Software outside of their trade, business, or profession) may have legal rights in their country of residence that could prevent certain limitations from applying to them. A lessee subleasing the Apple Software, who is also considered a lessor under Section 3, must fully relinquish exclusive use for use only in a list of specified countries and regions. The text discusses the terms of use for Apple-branded software. It states that the software provided with a specific Apple-branded hardware product may not be compatible with other Apple-branded hardware models. The software can be used in virtual operating system environments, but only a single instance or copy can be virtualized. The Lessor, or provider, is responsible for ensuring that the Lessee, or user, complies with all license terms and assists Apple in enforcing compliance. The text also prohibits interference with Apple's verification, storage, or authentication mechanisms. The countries listed at the beginning of the text are not connected to the rest of the information. The text discusses the security mechanisms implemented by Apple in its software, services, and content. It mentions digital rights management and signing among these mechanisms. The text also refers to Apple's Wallet service, which is provided with certain implied or statutory warranties and conditions, including merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement of third-party rights. Information will be sent to Apple to determine eligibility and prevent fraud. The Wallet service is subject to terms and conditions, which can be accessed through the device's settings.\n"
