It also mentions the Wallet feature, which allows the storage of virtual representations of credit, debit, and prepaid cards. The text also outlines the terms of use for Apple Pay & Wallet, stating that the user must have employer authorization to bind their employer to these terms. The text also discusses the terms of use for Apple's software, including AMR encoding and decoding functionality, which is not licensed for use in cellular communications infrastructure. Users are prohibited from altering any proprietary notices on the software. The terms also cover the use of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, which are considered a \"Service\" under the license. The text discusses licensing terms for the use of Apple Software, particularly those that contain AVC encoding and/or decoding functionality. Commercial use of H.264/AVC requires additional licensing, which can be obtained from MPEG LA, LLC. The text outlines the terms of a license for Apple Software obtained from the Mac App Store or through a software update. The license allows for a one-time permanent transfer of all rights to the software to another party, under certain conditions: the software must be transferred with Apple-branded hardware, and the transfer must include all of the software. The software will periodically check with Apple for updates. For UK-based consumers, the license is governed by local laws. The license also prohibits reverse engineering, disassembling, decrypting, modifying, or creating derivative works of the software, unless such restrictions are prohibited by law. The text discusses the terms of Apple's software license. It mentions that fonts can be embedded in content if allowed by the font's embedding restrictions. It clarifies that updates to Apple software are included in the license. The text also states that Apple is not a financial institution and that location data provided by Apple software is for basic navigation and planning only. The software cannot be exported or re-exported unless authorized by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction where the software was obtained. Apple may provide access to third-party software or services as part of the software package or as an upgrade, update, or supplement. Users are not allowed to exploit these services. The text outlines the terms of use for Gracenote data, software, and servers, stating that they should not be exploited except as expressly permitted. It warns that sharing credentials with a third party could lead to unauthorized transactions. The text also states that users should not use Apple Software and Services to spam, defraud, harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or infringe on the rights of others. Apple is not responsible for any misuse by the user or any offensive or illegal messages received as a result of using their software and services. The terms of use can be found on Apple's legal sales support page. The text outlines terms and conditions for Apple's services and software. It states that to obtain a refund, the entire hardware/software package must be returned. Redistribution of Flight Data requires prior written consent from the FAA. It also mentions that Apple does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free services, continued availability of services, correction of defects, or compatibility with third-party software or services. Some software libraries and third-party software included with Apple Software are free and licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the GNU Library. The text discusses software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the GNU Library/Lesser General Public License (LGPL). It specifies that the software documentation is licensed to U.S. Government end users only as commercial products and with the same rights as other end users. The text also states that Apple, Apple Payment Services, and their affiliates do not assume liability for any commerce activity made using Apple Pay or Wallet. Instead, users are advised to refer to their agreements with their card issuer, payment network, or merchant for any questions or disputes related to their supported cards and associated commerce activities. The text discusses any questions or disputes related to supported cards and associated commerce activities. It specifies that customers who are consumers (those using the Apple Software outside of their trade, business, or profession) may have legal rights in their country of residence that could prevent certain limitations from applying to them. If a lessee subleases the Apple Software, they must fully relinquish exclusive use for use only in specified countries and regions, including Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, China mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, and Ireland. The text discusses the terms of use for Apple-branded software. It states that the software provided with a specific Apple-branded hardware product may not be compatible with other Apple-branded hardware models. The software can be used in virtual operating system environments, but only a single instance or copy can be virtualized. The Lessor, or provider, is responsible for ensuring that the Lessee, or user, complies with all license terms and assists Apple in enforcing compliance. The text also prohibits interference with Apple's verification, storage, or authentication mechanisms. The countries listed at the beginning of the text do not seem to be directly related to the rest of the information. The text discusses the security mechanisms implemented by Apple in its software, services, and content. It mentions digital rights management and signing among these mechanisms. The text also refers to Apple's Wallet service, which is provided with certain implied or statutory warranties and conditions, including merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement of third-party rights. Information will be sent to Apple to determine eligibility and prevent fraud. The Wallet service is subject to terms and conditions, which can be accessed through the settings of supported devices.\n"
